#Microsoft Bot Framework Hands-On Lab: Mars Challenge

Welcome to the Mars Challenge. The Mars Challenge is a series of hands-on labs with a twist to it... You will be briefed on your missions later on in the lab. 

**Please do NOT click into any other pages in this repo until told to do so!**

###Prerequisites (try to do before the lab starts)

- Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/). After you've installed this, open your command line and run `npm install npm -g`. This updates Node's Package Manager (npm) to the latest version.
- Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (or any other code editor of your choice)
- Install [Bot Framework emulator](https://emulator.botframework.com)
- Azure account if you plan on deploying your bot to a channel in the Bot Framework Developer Portal - basically making it available to the world on many channels supported (Skype, Slack, Kik, etc.).

###Lab content

- **Mission 1:** Creating the bot and linking to LUIS (you've already made this model)
- **Mission 2:** Getting news from Earth through the bot
- **Mission 3:** Identifying objects using the Computer Vision API (DIY Challenge)
- **Connect:** Connecting the bot to other channels
