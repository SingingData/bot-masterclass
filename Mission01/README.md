# First Node.js Apps with Smarts

Here, you'll find two labs:  `News.md` and `LUIS.md`.  Just click on each file here to begin the lab, but first read these brief introductions.

First is `News.md`.  This one will lead you through getting a key for the API and code snippets you need to create a Node.js app or server-side code to grab the latest science and technology news.  The API in use is [Bing News Search](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/bing-news-search-api).

Second is `LUIS.md` which is designed more in the context of creating a bot to be able handle natural language.  This is a good segue into our discussion around bots and the Bot Framework.  LUIS app creation first involves training a model with new data (sample sentences) after defining a user's intents (what someone wants) and entities (people, places or things).  Will we use this same model in our final exercise so all is not for naught.
