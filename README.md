# Welcome to the Developing and Deploying Intelligent Chat Bots Class

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/conf-bots/Lobby](https://badges.gitter.im/conf-bots/Lobby.svg)](https://gitter.im/analytics-at-ms/conf-bots?utm_source=share-link&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=share-link)


## Introduction

This tutorial is designed for developers and data scientists. It will ramp up the attendee quickly on the Microsoft Bot Framework as a development tool/portal and the Cognitive Services APIs for intelligence, linking the two in the creation of an intelligent chat bot for conversational platforms. Thoughtful design, much like in Data Science, as well as user experience will be emphasized to create the best bot experiences.

4. **Visual Studio Code** \[recommended\] or equivalent code editing and debugging environment with IntelliSense.  
  * https://code.visualstudio.com/download
5. **Bot Framework Emulator** (Windows and Unix-compatible) installed locally - information and links at
  * https://docs.botframework.com/en-us/tools/bot-framework-emulator
8.  **GitHub Account** - a code repository and collaboration tool we'll use
  * https://github.com/join
*  **Git Bash** - included in git download
