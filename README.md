## Introduction

This short course is designed for developers and data scientists. It is a fun set of hands-on labs that build upon each other interweaving Microsoft Cognitive Services and the Bot Framework that, by the end, results in an intelligent chat bot that can be used on channels like Skype, Teams, and Slack among others.

## Learning path for students

Your mission if you choose to accept is to perform the following sets of labs in order (they build on each other).

**If you are self-guided, note that there are handouts for this course in the Extras folder**

1.  **[Prerequisites](#prerequisites)**:  You must take care of these to see this course through.
1.  **[Bootcamp](Bootcamp)**:  A quick, fun and fast introduction to the idea of webservers in Node.js (relates closely to bots)
2.  **[Mission01](Mission01)**:  A set of labs for creating a webserver to call Bing News and Language Understanding and Intelligent Service (intended to be instructor-guided)
3.  **[Mission02](Mission02)**:  A set of labs creating your first set of chat bots with the Micrsoft Bot Framework (intended to be instructor-guided)
4.  **[Mission_Final](Mission_Final)**:  A set of challenges/labs to create an intelligent chat bot to check the news on Earth and identify objects in images - both useful if living on a different planet (this is a fun, challenging set of labs for independent work).

4. **Visual Studio Code** \[recommended\] or equivalent code editing and debugging environment with IntelliSense.  
  * https://code.visualstudio.com/download
5. **Bot Framework Emulator** (Windows and Unix-compatible) installed locally - information and links at
  * https://docs.botframework.com/en-us/tools/bot-framework-emulator
8.  **GitHub Account** - a code repository and collaboration tool we'll use
  * https://github.com/join
*  **Git Bash** - included in git download
  * https://git-scm.com/downloads
9.  [Recommended]**Azure account** - use the one you have, sign up for a free trial at https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/, or, if you have an MSDN account and Azure as a benefit, link your Microsoft Account or Work/School Account to MSDN and activate the Azure benefit by following [this](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/docs/setup-admin/team-services/link-msdn-subscription-to-organizational-account-vs) guide

We will assume you have already have the following background:
